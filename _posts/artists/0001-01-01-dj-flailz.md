As an Islander whose spent 10 years in front of DJs as a fan, decided to put his ear for uplifting, bass pumping music into making the crowd dance until they can't! Flailz energy behind the decks is outstanding. His love of music and love to twist it up a bit, tends to make the crowd flail. Currently using Traktor Pro, vinyl and CDJs, You're likely to see him at a party near you.
