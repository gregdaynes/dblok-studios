DJ Critical's productions have been featured in Beatport's Top 100 Dubstep, Breaks, and Glitch Hop charts. His early works earned him both vinyl and digital releases on UK labels such as Mechanoise and Waveshape Records. His single "The way I feel" gained BBC Radio One play, on the legendary Annie Nightingale's show (UK). Later works went on such labels as Dusted breaks, and Nu Industry recordings, where the song "Hype the funk" got the remix touch by artists Calvertron and Tom EQ.

He's collaborated on tracks with the likes of Xim and Bass during time in Spain, and more recently with The Lightshapers for Spanish label Elektroshok. As well, he's done remix work for artists such as Anti-science and N.U.D.L.Z., owner of Rapid Fire Records. Support from Afghan Headspin, Reso, Hellfire Machina, Nom de Strip, Reid speed, Peo De Pitte, and more. Expect to see other works and collaborations out on various labels later 2012.
