Heavy Send ( Brodie Peterson) came into the electronic music scene in late 2009 and fell in love. After playing countless parties all over Vancouver Island and growing his name as a hard hitter, Heavy Send moved to Alberta to perfect his skills. Now back and ready to rumble! Heavy Send is unleashing something new on the world! With appearances coming up on labels such as "Adapted Records" and "Ghetto Funk Records" Heavy Send is something you wonâ€™t want to miss!
