Performance and music have been a part S.K.Bass’ life for as long as she can remember. By age 7 she was performing in piano recitals and musical theater in her hometown of Duncan BC. To this day S.K.’s passions remain the same. She spends her days working in Canada’s television industry, and her nights blowing up speakers around BC’s club and party scene.

In the past year and a half, S.K. has held down a residency called BASSLINES at Lick Club in Vancouver and had a weekly timeslot on a British webradio station where she was both the sole female DJ and only Canadian.

S.K.Bass’ sets are focused on danceability. If she doesn’t get you moving, no one will. She fuses oldschool throwbacks with fresh, cutting-edge stormers that will fill any dancefloor. Don’t be surprised if she tears out some classic dance hits or booty bass tracks from the 1990s either. S.K.Bass will always get the party started right, and quickly!
