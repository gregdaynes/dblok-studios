The Beat Junky, Nick, has always had a love for music and dancing; finding Break Dancing in 1983, he began teaching, and competing on Vancouver Island. With this fuelling his passion for the arts he grew to appreciate the many Genre's of Electronic music.

He began on home CD players in 1995; mixing Techno, House and Industrial, and progressed to turntables in 1996, primarily mixing Drum and Bass on vinyl. He now plays on Scratch Live, joining the modern age both technically and musically.

The Beat Junky has played all over Vancouver Island, on the Main Land, as well as the Gulf Islands. With the formation of the Temple of Gong (T.O.G.), a small group of DJ’s that would 'renegade' parties, The Beat Junky was able to establish himself as a DJ. The Beat Junky’s genres include, among the many: Drum-n-Bass (Raga, Jungle, Jump-up, Drumstep, Dark Liquid & Tribal Halfstep); Dubstep, and Glitch-hop.

As well as doing projects with Harostraight on live Violin, D.J.M and now with Noodles playing as Tribal Vision on 4 decks & 3 mixers as well with Sireno on Didgeridoo's If it has a broken beat he is not far away!

He has opened for the likes of Freaky Flow, DubFX, DJ Raw, Capital-J. Heyoka, Ill-Gates, Mat the Alien, The Dirt Crew… As well as being a full time single parent, he is also a body piercer in Duncan, at Mike's Tattoos; however Nick will not let life get in his way and after two years of fumbling with Scratch Live there is a new Beat on the rise, ready for anything with huge bass and a massive sound.
