Sean MacMillan (MrMacHimself) has been making a fair bit of NOISE in the West coast club and Rave Scene since late 2010. With headlining slots in cities around Vancouver Island and the lower Mainland, but its not going to stop there.

Drawing influence from many genre's of music, its sometimes a toss up as to what you will hear next when MrMacHimself is in the MIX. Originating from the Smooth sounds of house, then working his way to Breaks, and everything wobbling in between, his style almost seems to SMASH you up in the right way.

A finalist for Victoria Night Life Awards "Best New DJ", the flood gates have been blown wide open for MrMac. Having the chance to play at some of Vancouver's TOP Night clubs, up and down the island a few times, also landing spots in almost every bar/club in Victoria, you will never know what style to expect MrMac to be playing.

MrMacHimself has had his sound played over the radio waves on Digitally Imported's Analog Airwaves (Host: Soulfix) along side many of the innovative EDM producer of the last decade. Notable names such as Alex Mind, Jay Robinson, Alex Speaker, Bassive, Defunct!, Atomic Drop, Fredrick Mooji, COOL PROJECT

Getting the chance to play along side some International and Canadian greats, Such as KILL THE NOISE(Mau5trap/OWSLA), MARK INSTINCT(ROTTUN), BRYX, BUSTA, StickyBuds, The Funk Hunters(Re-Groove/GhettoFunk), Stylus Beats, Glitchy & Scratchy, Nom De Strip, Kytami, The Slag (Suave Assasins), TYCO, The Funk Junkie, Tantric Decks aka Steve Velocity, J.A.DJ (TruSpin), Mykee(Reliable Ent), Sk'ian(Reliable Ent), DJ Souls, City of 9's, Synba, Spoon, The Beat Junky, DJ Keyes, Gumbootz, Ben Chemikal, James Dean, Soulfix and Chi-No just to name a few, MrMac's name has been solidified within the ranks of the West Coast Night Lifeâ€¦Now how far does he go from here?!
