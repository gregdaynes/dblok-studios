Out of Duncan B.C. at an early age Evan Johnson was introduced to turn tables where he would learn the basics and continue to open his mind into the electronic world. Soon enough Evan bought a set of his own and quickly learned the trade by himself. From there he jumped right into Vancouver Islands fast growing EDM scene and played events all over the island sharing the stage with artists such as; The Beat Junkie, Gumbootz, Beatsmith, Monty, Chemikal, The Wobble-Skankz, SK Bass, and many more Island talents.

After establishing a name in the Vancouver Island EDM scene RoyalTease gained a monthly residency at Hush Nightclub in Victoria B.C. along side D.U.I, DJ RITCHIE, and opening for Vancouver artist The Slag.

RoyalTease is known for his high energy behind the decks and with that he will always bring a track list that hits you with a bang! Playing filthy Dub-step/Drum-step, and dirty electro house without missing anything between.

You will definitely not want to miss his next set, as he is ready to destroy dance floors all over the Island, RoyalTease will keep you moving all night and leave you wanting more!
