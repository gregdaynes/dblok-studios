Normally quiet and reserved, Industrial has a tendancy to be sporadic in musical taste. On one end of the spectrum he'll fill you up with Minimal sounds to the other end, full of breakbeats where you'll be assaulted and feel broken when it's over. You'll never know quite what to expect from Mr. Industrial, his Jekyll & Hyde behavior can surprise you.
