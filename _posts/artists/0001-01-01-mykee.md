A veteran of over 10 years, Mykee is one of the island's most versatile and on demand DJs and this summer was no different, as he performed all the major events like Soundwave Music Festival, VEMF (Victoria Electronic Music Festival), Summerbreak Music Festival, Breakwater Gathering, as well as the Superfriends, Funkalicious, and Pump it Louder series.

Always searching for the perfect beat, his acquired taste in music will grab your attention and make your ass shake on its own! Mike has a knack for educating and entertaining a crowd at the same time when he plays. With his vast knowledge of electronic music, and ability to read a crowd, he knows what to play and when to play it. His ability to surprise a crowd every time he plays after all this time is nothing short of amazing.

Mike is excited to rock Hush, and says it has been, and will always be his favourite place to play. He will be playing a set of mostly Soulful, Groovy House, infused with some Filthy Bass Line House. Mike has been a huge part of the Vancouver Island scene with his company Reliable Productions, contributing some of the largest and most memorable parties and DJ sets to date. It's no wonder he's Vancouver Island's number 1 Party Rocker!
