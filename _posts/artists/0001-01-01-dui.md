Sean McCallum 'Triple XL' and Clayton Briffett 'Teddy Gram'. Hailing from Victoria, BC to bring you one thing: BASS. Spinning the Dirtiest Electro, Filthiest Dub-step/Drum-step and everything else in between. Starting in early 2010 spinning electro house as "The Three Stooges," playing random house and bush parties, were quickly noticed by a local DJ "Plastic Motive" and were taken under next step entertainment. After playing many electro shows, Clayton And Sean decided they wanted to open up to a wider variety of generes and started a sub group as D.U.I. in October 2011. Since then, they have held down a monthly residency at Victoria's Hush night club, as well as playing at the 2012 Victoria Electronic Music festival. Guaranteed to keep you out of your seat and have your feet moving all night, DUI is ready to bring the noise to Victoria.
