Monty, the man behind 4theMusic, always gets the crowd bumpin' with his funky electro-house. You'll often see him behind the controls from start to end proving that he's as talented behind a sound board as he is behind a dj mixer. He's paid his dues and gained a position among the Vancouver Island electonic music scene's foremost promoters. This being said, don't be fooled into thinking that he's not in it for the girls and the frika-frika-free beer.
