Whether he's opening for international superstars like Tipper, Bassnectar and the Freestylers; rocking a headlining slot at an outdoor party or providing backdrop beats in a local lounge, Generic is the kind of DJ who fully brings it, whatever the gig. His combination of technical skills (the guy has taken several Vancouver Island DJ competition titles), impeccable ear for crowd-rocking tunes and a fun-loving attitude makes Generic (nee Cole Magnusson) one of the Island's most sough-after disc jockeys. Expect one of his sets to be chock-a-block with broken beats, glitch hop, drum and bass and dubstep—including some of his own tracks, edits and remixes—with plenty of cutting and scratching thrown in for good measure. With skills like that, it's no surprise this 10-year vet behind the decks rarely goes a weekend without dropping a set
