G-rant has been rocking out since the early days of Raving. Hearing Psytrance for the first time at the old solstice parties back in '98 he was hooked. Since then he has spent many winters in Thailand, India and Mexico searching out Psytrance parties.

In 2000 G-rant moved from Vancouver to Tofino. He soon became one of the local Tofino favourites. In 2001 G-rant and his friends started up SPDM Productions and started doing local bar nights, It wasn't long until there first outdoor party in 2002 "DICA" which was a huge success. Since then SPDM has had the Privilege of hosting "DICA" Parties every year, showcasing numerous local and international DJs.

He also helps organize an outdoor festival "KARMA", which is a trance dance gathering held in Vancouver. G-rants experience and style will keep you stomping either through the night or day! G-rant's motto "Long live Psytrance". G-rant has shared stage with Space Tribe, Earthling, Domino, EVP, Reality Grid, Solar and many others.
