When asked "What style of music do you play", JFI aka Jon-E Industry can only describe it as "BANGIN SHIT". It's this blend of Electro House, Breakbeat, Dubstep, & Drum & Bass that has helped establish his presence in such a short amount of time.

Although he had been Promoting and Djing events for several years, it wasn't until late 2007 that he decided it was time to start taking Music Production seriously. After 8 months of dedicated, hard work in the studio, Jonny had signed his first official remix deal, and now boasts releases on powerhouse labels such as BugEyed Records, DLA Black, Champion Beats, Play Digital, Big Fish Recordings, and Miles Dyson's Plasmapool Records.

During his short time in the game he has earned himself places on the Beatport, Trackitdown, Junodownload.com's Top 100 charts including holding down the #1 and #2 spots on Dancerecord.com consecutively! With a stash of bass music ready for war he has no plans of slowing down, so expect the unexpected as he fights his way through the ranks and takes the music industry by force!
