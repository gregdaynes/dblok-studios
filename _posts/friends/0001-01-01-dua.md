With a love for beer, bacon and heavy bass lines, Dua is a guy who knows his priorities in life. Having attended his first EDM party over 15 years ago and with a strong 10 years working in the production industry, he has an obsessive passion for electronic music. As the boss at DLD Productions and a volunteer at the Village Stage at Shambhala, he is constantly surrounded by a variety of sounds orbiting the low end.

While not confined to any particular genre, Dua is comfortable rinsing out everything from smooth rollers to aggressive, bone rattling bass lines. You can be guaranteed to hear the freshest in Drum and Bass, Jungle, Dubstep, Glitch and Hip hop during one of Dua’s sets.

Never one to do the status quo, Dua time and time again shows why it’s true; Don’t Dua what Dua don’t Dua!
