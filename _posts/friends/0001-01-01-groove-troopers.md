The Groove Troopers, Two of the funnest, most likeable guys around have finally combined their skills to create a dancefloor smashing force.

One part “Ziggy” (Dan Coogan), A colourful presence who established himself first as a promoter and moved into performing, bringing a badass bass presence to the team with anything from Ghetto Funk to Breaks, He packs a punch into every track.

One Part “Trenton” (Trenton Sauve), A genuine “nice guy” who spent his early years as diehard fan of the local talents, he finally acquired an old pair of tables and a handful of records and hasn’t looked back since, Bringing some of the smoothest mixing around to the team in anything from Electro to DnB with a flow that cant be matched.

These two cats are always fired up and ready to rock so prepare for some wild times.
