This brilliant bird may have danced circles around you back in the day, but now she is getting her feet nice and wet with phat bass lines and funky bumpers. Although she loves to dabble in the new, her real passion is bringing back the old.. and she often finds herself smack dab in the middle of mixes that defy time all together. Close your eyes. Get ready to smile, and listen for the hidden recognizable.
