Dubris, you've seen the name on flyers all over town, but you're probably still pronouncing it all wrong. It doesn't sound like vicious, though that's certainly how you could describe his preferred style of Drum & Bass, Dubstep, and anything else that's liable to knock your socks off. Debris, like the glass that rained down on him in Eagle's Hall when the bass from one of his own productions shattered a light bulb overhead - only spelled with a 'U' because you're the one who's gonna get it next.
