We are preparing to launch a new website in the coming weeks. We currently do not have a set time frame in place, but it will most likely be in the fall.

With this new site, comes new direction. D-Blok Studios has undergone a change in management over the past few months. With one of our co-founders stepping asside from day-to-day activies, leaving his long time friend and fellow co-founder to take the reigns.

> Hard at work, we are aiming to make the rest of 2013 and 2014 great years for music and entertainment on Vancouver Island

Along with the change in management, we will also be shifting our focus away from being purely electronic music to more bands and production work. Stay tuned for live shows.

We will not be leaving the electronic scene completely. We have a number of artists who are producing top notch material for release on our label in the coming months.

Just thought I'd leave an update.
